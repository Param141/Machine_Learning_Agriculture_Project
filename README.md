# Machine Learning for Ridge Gourd Classification 🌱

## Overview
This project focuses on applying **machine learning and deep learning techniques** to classify ridge gourd images. The dataset was **self-created and preprocessed** to ensure quality and consistency, followed by training with multiple models to benchmark performance. This Project Resulted in an Conference Paper Presented at MIND 2025 conference.

## Key Features
- 📸 **Custom Dataset**: Ridge gourd images collected and curated manually.  
- 🧹 **Preprocessing**: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation for robust training.  
- 🤖 **Model Training**: Implemented and compared multiple ML/DL models including:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - Hybrid CNN architectures
  - MobileNet & MobileNetV2
  - Custom CNN variants
  - SVM + CNN combinations. 
- 📊 **Performance Evaluation**: Accuracy and loss metrics tracked across models.
